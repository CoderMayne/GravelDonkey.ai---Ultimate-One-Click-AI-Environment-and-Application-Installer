# Fixes Implemented for GravelDonkey.ai

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. FFmpeg Installation Error
- **Issue**: `[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'wsl'` when trying to install FFmpeg
- **Fix**: 
  - Improved error handling to detect if running inside WSL vs Windows
  - Hidden the FFmpeg installation button as requested
  - Added proper WSL detection logic

### 2. Hardware Detection Improvements
- **Issue**: RTX 5080 detection with incorrect compute capability
- **Fix**:
  - Updated RTX 5080 to use correct sm_90 compute capability
  - Fixed memory specification (16GB instead of 20GB)
  - Set RTX 5080 as default simulation model
  - Added proper CUDA 12.8+ requirement note

### 3. Simulation Mode Separation
- **Issue**: Simulation mode was mixed with hardware detection
- **Fix**:
  - Made simulation mode a separate optional function
  - Kept "Detect Hardware" as the main button
  - Simulation controls are now in an accordion (Advanced section)

### 4. AI Recommendations Section
- **Issue**: Missing categories and "No Description" errors
- **Fix**:
  - Fixed initial state to show "Not detected" instead of empty
  - Added proper hardware-optimized recommendations
  - Improved visual layout with better descriptions

### 5. Applications Section Enhancements
- **Issue**: Missing categories and descriptions
- **Fix**:
  - Created comprehensive applications database with 50+ highly rated apps
  - Added rating system (sorted by rating, highest first)
  - Added proper categories: Image Generation, Text Generation, Audio Processing, Computer Vision, etc.
  - Added detailed descriptions for each application
  - Included port information and installation commands

### 6. Step 5 Visibility Improvements
- **Issue**: Step 5 was not prominent enough
- **Fix**:
  - Added gradient background header with gear icon
  - Enhanced button styling and spacing
  - Added visual confirmation when configuration is approved
  - Improved download button styling

### 7. Missing Tutorials Tab
- **Issue**: No tutorials or learning resources
- **Fix**:
  - Added comprehensive Tutorials tab before Exit tab
  - Included guides for:
    - Stable Diffusion setup and usage
    - Large Language Models
    - Audio processing workflows
    - Computer Vision projects
    - Development and deployment
    - Useful resources and links

### 8. Exit Button Audio Enhancement
- **Issue**: Exit button should play donkey sound
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced donkey sound functionality
  - Added audio preview in Exit tab
  - Improved fallback sound system for different platforms
  - Added proper audio file detection and playback

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements
