# GravelDonkey.ai - Ultimate One-Click AI Environment and Application Installer
This project, the "Ultimate One-Click AI Environment and Application Installer," provides a user-friendly web interface built with Gradio to simplify the setup of complex AI development environments. It addresses the challenge of managing numerous dependencies and configurations by automating the process of creating a tailored Docker container for your specific needs.  Key features include:  Cross-Platform: Runs on both Windows (with WSL2) and native Linux (Ubuntu) systems. Hardware-Aware Configuration: Automatically detects your GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) and system specifications to recommend optimized versions of core dependencies like CUDA, PyTorch, and more. GPU Simulation: For users without specific hardware, the application can simulate different GPU environments, allowing for testing and development of configurations for various setups. Customizable Application Builds: Users can select from a list of popular AI applications and tools to be included in their Docker image. Automated Dockerfile Generation: Based on your selections, the application generates a complete and ready-to-use Dockerfile and associated scripts. Built-in Prerequisite Checker: An integrated tool helps you diagnose and fix any missing prerequisites on your host system, ensuring a smoother setup process. This tool is ideal for developers, researchers, and hobbyists who want to quickly spin up a containerized, hardware-accelerated environment with their favorite AI tools, without the hassle of manual configuration.
